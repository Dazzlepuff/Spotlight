.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Defines cube coordinates and hashing utilities for hex-grid operations\&. 

This file provides the \fBCubeCoord\fP structure used to represent positions in a 3D cube coordinate system (commonly used for hexagonal grids) and a custom hash functor to enable their use as keys in unordered containers\&.
