.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Represents a collection of cards and provides utility operations for card management\&. 

The \fBDeck\fP class encapsulates a vector of \fBCard\fP objects along with a name identifier\&. It supports loading cards from external JSON data, shuffling the deck, drawing cards, and transferring them to other decks\&. The design is extensible for various game contexts that require deck-based operations\&. 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "Deck::Deck (const std::string & deckName = \fR''\fP)\fR [inline]\fP"

.PP
Constructs a deck with an optional name\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIdeckName\fP Optional name identifier for the deck\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
\fBDeck\fP is initialized with an empty card list\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void Deck::addCard (const \fBCard\fP & card)"

.PP
Adds a card to the deck\&. Adds a card directly to the deck vector\&.

.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIcard\fP The card to be added\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
The card is appended to the end of the internal vector\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "\fBCard\fP Deck::drawCard ()"

.PP
Draws the topmost card from the deck\&. Removes the last card from the internal vector (LIFO order) and returns it\&. If the deck is empty, an empty \fBCard\fP is returned instead\&.

.PP
\fBPrecondition\fP
.RS 4
The deck should contain at least one card\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
The deck’s size decreases by one, unless empty\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The drawn \fBCard\fP object\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
Returns a default-constructed \fBCard\fP if the deck is empty\&.
.RE
.PP
Returns the last element of the vector to simulate drawing from the top\&. Logs an error if called on an empty deck and returns a default card\&. 
.SS "bool Deck::empty () const"

.PP
Checks whether the deck is empty\&. Returns true if there are no cards remaining in the deck\&.

.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True if the deck has no cards, false otherwise\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
Does not modify the deck\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void Deck::loadFromJsonFile (const std::string & filename)"

.PP
Loads cards into the deck from a JSON file\&. The JSON file must contain an array of card definitions compatible with the \fBCard\fP class constructor\&. Each card may optionally define a \fR"copies"\fP field indicating how many duplicates to create\&.

.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIfilename\fP The name or relative path of the JSON file to load\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPrecondition\fP
.RS 4
The file must exist and contain valid JSON\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
The deck’s card list is cleared and replaced with the loaded cards\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBExceptions\fP
.RS 4
\fIstd::exception\fP If JSON parsing fails (caught internally and logged)\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
Logs errors to stderr if the file cannot be found or opened\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBSee also\fP
.RS 4
\fBCard::Card(const nlohmann::json&)\fP
.RE
.PP
Uses \fBPathUtils::getAssetPath()\fP to resolve the full path of the file\&. Cards are loaded from JSON, supporting an optional "copies" field for duplication\&. Any parsing or I/O errors are printed to stderr\&. 
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Default copies = 1 unless explicitly defined in JSON\&.
.RE
.PP

.SS "void Deck::moveCardTo (const \fBCard\fP & card, \fBDeck\fP & deck)"

.PP
Transfers a card to another deck\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIcard\fP The card to move\&. 
.br
\fIdeck\fP The destination deck that receives the card\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
The specified card is added to the destination deck\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This operation does not remove the card from the source deck\&.
.RE
.PP
Only appends the card to the destination deck — it does not remove it locally\&. This enables flexible gameplay behavior (e\&.g\&., cloning, discarding)\&. 
.SS "void Deck::shuffle ()"

.PP
Randomly shuffles the order of cards in the deck\&. Uses a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator seeded from std::random_device\&. Suitable for gameplay randomness but not cryptographically secure\&.

.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
All cards remain present, but in randomized order\&.
.RE
.PP
Uses std::shuffle with Mersenne Twister (mt19937) seeded from random_device\&. Ensures fair shuffling each time it’s called\&. 
.SS "size_t Deck::size () const"

.PP
Gets the number of cards currently in the deck\&. Returns the current card count in the deck\&.

.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The count of cards\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBPostcondition\fP
.RS 4
Does not modify the deck\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SH "Member Data Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "std::vector<\fBCard\fP> Deck::cards"

.PP
The internal storage of cards contained within the deck\&. 
.SS "std::string Deck::name"

.PP
The deck’s name, used for identification or debugging\&.
